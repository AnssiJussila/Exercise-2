# Exercise-2
The exercise for this week is meant to help you better understand data types and lists in Python, and practice saving files to GitHub.
Below you have a series of "problems" in which you will be asked to either download and modify, or create new script files.
After making you changes, you will need to upload them to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).

**Contents:**



should be pretty simple and comprises two parts.
First, you need to go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account. 
Second, you need to go through the process of using one of the cloud computers from start to finish. 
Both tasks are described below, as well as what you need to submit for each task.

## Things the students should do in this exercise
1. Download a file from their GitHub repo for Exercise 2, modify and re-upload.
2. Create a new file and upload it.
3. Modify the existing README.md to add some markdown stuff.
4. Add an image to the repo and link to it in the README.md file.
5. Download a zip of the entire repository?
